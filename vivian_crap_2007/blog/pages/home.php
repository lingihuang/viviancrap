				<div class="texts">Welcome coming to <span style="color: #800400;">LINGIHUANG.COM</span>. This site is the first version I built. In the process of building my site, I focused on design and contents organzied.  The only two sections to show my coding ability are my works and my photo gallery. I dealt this with Action Script, PHP, and MySQL.</div>
				<div class="texts">Regarding my site, I have my personal records, some works to present what techniques I have, some impressive links, and my photos. Additionally, welcome any comments or suggestions about my site.</div>
				<div class="texts">The last thing I would like to mention here is there is nothing to do with this site, but he’s the one who helped me open my mind to see what design is. I hope that I can show him from this stie how much he helped his student and how much his student appreciated him. Therefore, the works I put here are probably not so much, but all were created after taking his class.</div>
